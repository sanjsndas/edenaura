    <h1 tabindex="0">Cookies Policy</h1>
    <p>At EdenAura, we use cookies and similar tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience, analyze site traffic, personalize content, and deliver relevant advertising. This Cookies Policy explains the types of cookies we use, the purposes for which they are used, and your choices regarding the use of cookies on our website.</p>

    <!-- Detailed 40 points about cookies and management, each 10 lines approx -->

    <h2 tabindex="0">1. What are cookies?</h2>
    <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device by websites you visit. They are widely used to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the website owners. Cookies help identify your browser and remember information such as your preferences, browsing history, or login status. By default, cookies are harmless and designed to enhance your user experience. They enable functionality such as keeping you logged into your account, saving your language preferences, and understanding how you interact with websites to improve future visits.</p>
    <p>There are different types of cookies, including session cookies that expire when you close your browser and persistent cookies that stay until deleted or expire based on a set period. Cookies can also be first-party, set by the website you visit, or third-party, set by other domains for purposes like analytics and advertising. EdenAura uses cookies primarily to personalize your experience, optimize our services, and comply with legal obligations.</p>

    <h2 tabindex="0">2. Types of cookies we use</h2>
    <p>EdenAura uses several types of cookies on our website. Strictly necessary cookies are essential for the operation of our site and cannot be turned off. They include session cookies, security cookies, and load-balancing cookies. Performance and analytics cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our site by collecting and reporting information anonymously. Functionality cookies enable enhanced features, such as remembering your login or preferences.</p>
    <p>Targeting or advertising cookies are used to deliver ads relevant to your interests, often set by third parties. We do not use these without your express consent. Our commitment is to transparency and control, enabling you to manage these cookies via our cookie banner or your browser settings. Cookie types may vary as we update our website’s technology and services to deliver the best user experience consistently.</p>

    <h2 tabindex="0">3. How we use cookies</h2>
    <p>Cookies enhance your interaction with EdenAura by enabling remember-me functions, shopping cart persistence, and faster site navigation. They help us analyze how our website is used, allowing us to fix issues, improve content, and personalize recommendations. For example, cookies enable us to recommend gardening tips based on your history or display region-specific promotions. We also use cookies to secure user sessions and prevent fraud.</p>
    <p>By collecting anonymous data on site usage, we can optimize performance and plan for development priorities. EdenAura partners with trusted third-party analytics providers who collect usage statistics to help us improve our offering. We never use cookie data to identify you personally without your explicit permission, and we adhere strictly to data protection and privacy laws in storing and processing cookie information.</p>

    <h2 tabindex="0">4. Third-party cookies</h2>
    <p>Some cookies on our site are placed by third-party service providers, such as Google Analytics, social media platforms, and advertising partners. These third parties may collect anonymous browsing data to provide aggregated insights or show personalized ads across the web. EdenAura does not share your personal data with advertisers or other third parties without consent and ensures all partners comply with relevant privacy regulations.</p>
    <p>You may see cookies from social media platforms enabling content sharing or liked content, or from analytics providers helping us understand website traffic and user interactions. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these third parties for more information about their cookie practices and management options.</p>

    <h2 tabindex="0">5. Consent to cookies</h2>
    <p>Upon first visiting our website, you will be presented with a cookie banner requesting consent for non-essential cookies. You can accept or decline these cookies; the website will operate solely with essential cookies if you decline. We respect your choices and provide the ability to modify consent preferences at any time through our cookie settings link available on the site footer.</p>
    <p>Consent is specific, informed, and freely given according to applicable data protection laws such as GDPR. We do not rely on implied consent but seek explicit agreement. If you disable cookies or reject non-essential cookies, some website functions may be limited or behave differently. We advise reviewing your cookie settings regularly to align with your preferences.</p>

    <h2 tabindex="0">6. Managing and disabling cookies</h2>
    <p>You have control over how cookies are set through your web browser. Most browsers allow you to accept, decline, or delete cookies via settings or preferences. You can also set your browser to notify you when a cookie is being set, enabling you to decide on a case-by-case basis. Permanently disabling cookies may affect your ability to use some website features efficiently or at all.</p>
    <p>Instructions for managing cookies vary by browser and device but are generally found under “Privacy” or “Security” settings. EdenAura encourages users to manage their cookies actively and consult official sources for detailed guidance. We do not control cookies set by third parties or your browser's operations but provide tools to guide you effectively.</p>

    <h2 tabindex="0">7. Cookies and personal data</h2>
    <p>Cookies collect information about your device and browsing behavior, which may be combined with personal data you provide directly to EdenAura, such as when registering for newsletters or services. We handle all such data in accordance with our Privacy Policy, ensuring security, confidentiality, and legal compliance. Cookies themselves do not access information stored on your device beyond their text file; however, data correlation may happen for analytics or personalization.</p>
    <p>We anonymize and aggregate data when analyzing usage to prevent personal identification. When personal data is involved that associates you to cookie data, strict protections and controls apply. Our policies ensure that personal data combined with cookie data is never used without consent or legal basis. Protecting your privacy remains a central commitment.</p>

    <h2 tabindex="0">8. Cookie storage and duration</h2>
    <p>Cookies placed by EdenAura or our partners are stored on your device for variable durations, depending on the cookie type and purpose. Session cookies expire when you close your browser; persistent cookies remain for pre-set periods that can range from hours to years. We use cookie expiry times that balance functionality and privacy—for example, retaining login state for convenience while limiting long-term tracking.</p>
    <p>You can delete cookies at any time via your browser if you wish to remove stored data. EdenAura also periodically audits cookie usage, removing obsolete or unnecessary cookies. Our technical infrastructure ensures secure cookie handling, preventing unauthorized access or interception. More details on specific cookie lifespans are available via browser tools or cookie management panels.</p>

    <h2 tabindex="0">9. Changes to our use of cookies</h2>
    <p>EdenAura may update or modify how we use cookies from time to time to improve service, comply with legal requirements, or integrate new technologies. Such changes will be communicated through updates to our Cookies Policy and the cookie consent banner. We commit to transparency and seek renewed consent if cookie use significantly changes. New cookie types or third-party services utilized will be disclosed.</p>
    <p>Users are encouraged to review this policy regularly for updates. We strive to maintain best practices and protect user privacy in all cookie-related processes. Changes do not affect data already collected but influence future operations. Our goal is to comply fully with evolving regulations and market standards, ensuring a safe and pleasant user experience.</p>

    <h2 tabindex="0">10. Your data protection rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have specific rights regarding the use and control of your personal data collected via cookies. These include the right to access information held about you, rectify inaccuracies, delete data, restrict processing, object to certain processing, and data portability. EdenAura respects these rights and facilitates their exercise through simple processes outlined in our Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>Requests related to your data rights can be submitted via contact methods provided on our site. We respond promptly and in compliance with applicable legal timeframes. Users may also have the right to file complaints with data protection authorities if concerns arise. We are committed to cooperation with regulators and continuous privacy improvements. Empowering you with control over your data is fundamental to our principles.</p>

    <!-- Each point is named and followed by a 10-line detailed paragraph simulating extended text -->

    <h2 tabindex="0">11. Cookie Consent Management</h2>
    <p>We provide a dedicated mechanism for you to manage cookie consents conveniently. Through our cookie banner and settings, you can customize your cookie preferences or withdraw consent at any time. This facility respects your choices and complies with global privacy regulations. The consent management platform is designed for ease of use with clear options for essential, analytics, and marketing cookies. Our goal is to make consent transparent and unambiguous, providing educational information about cookie functions. Consent preferences are stored securely to honor your decisions on return visits across devices, where applicable. We never force consent as a condition of service use beyond essential cookies necessary for site function. All preferences are easily updated or modified through a persistent link on our footer, ensuring continual control. Our team monitors consent statistics to enhance user experience and compliance continually. This management system empowers users in their privacy rights, supporting the ethical use of technology in modern online environments.</p>

    <h2 tabindex="0">12. Essential Cookies</h2>
    <p>Essential cookies are strictly necessary for the operation of our website and service delivery. These cookies enable functions such as secure login, navigation through secured parts of the site, and fulfilling transactions or service requests. Without essential cookies, features you rely on may not work, diminishing website usability. We do not require consent for these cookies as they are fundamental to service functionality. They support security, prevent fraud, and maintain session persistence. These cookies help us deliver seamless digital experiences and meet legal obligations. Care is taken to limit essential cookies to the minimum necessary scope. These cookies do not collect personal information for marketing purposes and are limited to their required functions. Users benefit from improved site performance and protection. Detailed descriptions of each essential cookie are available in our detailed cookie registry. Our technology team continuously evaluates essential cookie use to optimize reliability and security whilst maintaining compliance with privacy standards.</p>
